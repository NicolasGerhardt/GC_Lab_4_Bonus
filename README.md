# Lab 4 *BONUS* Igpay Atinlay
## Task
Translate from English to Pig Latin.

## What will the Application do?
* The application prompts the user for a word.
* The application translates the text to Pig Latin and displays it on the console.
* The application asks the user if he or she wants to translate another word.

## Build Specifications/Grading Requirements
1. Convert the word to a lowercase before translating.
1. If a word starts with a vowel, just add “way” onto the ending.
1. If a word starts with a consonant, move all of the consonants that appear before the first vowel to the end of the word, then add “ay” to the end of the word.
1. Treat “y” as a consonant.

## Extended Exercises
* Don’t translate words that have numbers or symbols. Ex: 189 should be left as 189 and hello@grandcircus.co should be left as hello@grandcircus.co.
* Check that the user has actually entered text before translating.
* Make the application take a line instead of a single word, and then find the Pig Latin for each word in the line.
* Keep the case of the word, whether it’s uppercase (ORDWAY), title case (Ordway), or lowercase (ordway).
